# Hi there
## About me
I am Kenny Hui (Better known as LX86)

Mainly coded in Java or Javascript, but occasionally there will be like C# or whatever.

I know this is a terrible README, forgive me.

I am quite active on both social media, so in the case you still haven't got any reply back within a few days:
- I am not interested in whatever you contacted me for. 
- I am probably sick.
- Touching all the grass across the entire earth.
