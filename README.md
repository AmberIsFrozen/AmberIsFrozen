# Hi there
## About me
I am Kenny Hui (or just call me LX86)

I like coding Minecraft Mod (When I have an idea that is), and maybe some websites or Discord Bot.

Most of my project usually just extends on what others has built in the past, but in the rare case I do have my own idea it will probably be coded in C# or Javascript.

I know this is a terrible README, forgive me.

## My Project
[BetterTellraw, a Fabric Mod that took less time to create than continue using /tellraw](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/BetterTellraw)

[MTR PIDS Simulator](https://github.com/HKTSS/mtr-pids)

### Upcoming Project
**LXBot v3, another another another typical Discord Bot written in Discord.js**

**OpenBVE Discord RPC, a Discord RPC for the train simulator [OpenBVE](https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE) (prob a very bad idea)**

## Contact
Discord: **LX86#2271** (Preferred)

Twitter: **@LX860**

I am quite active on both social media, so in the case you still haven't got any reply back within a few days:
- You contacted me for NFT related stuff
- I am probably sick
- I might be touching LOTS of grass
- You guessed it.
