# Hi there
## About me
I am Kenny Hui (Better known as LX86), very average teens who likes to code stuff based on my interest, or what I need.

Mainly coding in Java and Javascript (yes yes I know), but occasionally there will be like C# or whatever.

Manages (And occasionally break) a minecraft server in [The District of Joban](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban).

Maybe I'll make a more fleshed out profile soon, but I hope this is enough to get the point across.

## Some projects I make
- [Splashfox](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/SplashFox)
- [DCLink, a half baked Fabric <-> Discord Mod](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/DCLink)
- [OpenBVE Discord RPC](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/obDRPC), a Discord RPC plugin for the train simulator [OpenBVE](https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE)

## Some other projects I make
These projects are less actively worked on / more or less considered "done" (Does not make it less awesome however!).
