# Hi there
## About me
I am Kenny Hui (Better known as LX86), and I pretty much try to code stuff to solve my pain point about using a computer (And including the software and games inside it).
Other time I'll just continue to be silly.

Manages (And occasionally break) a modded Minecraft server in [The District of Joban](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban).  
Sometimes work on OpenBVE content in [Hong Kong Transport Simulation Studio](https://github.com/HKTSS).

## Projects
### OpenBVE
*OpenBVE is an open-source train simulator that I played around with for a few years.  
Nowadays I would try to get some small fixes to upstream, though I also had made some content about it.*

Here are some of my OpenBVE projects:
- [Light Rail Phase IV Vehicle](https://github.com/HKTSS/LRV-P4)
- [OpenBVE Discord RPC](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/obDRPC), an "Input Device Plugin" that adds Discord Rich Presence for OpenBVE, including live train statuses.

### Minecraft
*Have I told you 3 billion devices run Java?*
- [BetterTellraw, a Fabric Mod that took less time to create than continue using /tellraw](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/BetterTellraw)
- [Splashfox](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/SplashFox)
- [DCLink, a (literally) half baked Fabric <-> Discord Mod](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/DCLink)
- [RecipeCooldown, a Fabric Mod that fixes some um idk Minecraft packet spam](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/RecipeCooldown)
- [TakeASeat, A Server-Side Fabric mod that allows you to sit on blocks??](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/TakeASeat)

### Minecraft (Minecraft Transit Railway)
*The [Minecraft Transit Railway Mod](https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway) is a Forge/Fabric (Architectury) mod that adds automated metro in Minecraft.  
Overtime I've developed several mod that modifies/add content on top of the MTR Mod, and while they aren't a *large* amount, it's probably better to open a new section anyway just in case.*

- [Logregator](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban/Logregator) - Send webhook messages to Discord (And hopefully revolt in the future) regarding in-game events. Optionally supports logging changes in MTR Mod data.
- [TransitManager](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban/TransitManager) - Add commands that allows you to have more control over indiviual train.
- [MTR-OTP](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban/MTR-OTP) - An experimental mod that uses frustum culling to skip rendering trains to achieve better fps (Pretty experimental and unreliable, long term solution is needed for the main mod)

### Other projects
*Usually very minor stuff, or I don't have any interesting story to tell for that project*
- [Sticker Lab, redrawing stickers seen in public places](https://lx862.com/sticker-lab)
- [MTR Light Rail PIDS Simulator, replica of the new Hong Kong Light Rail PIDS](https://github.com/HKTSS/nlrt-pids)
- [MTR PIDS Simulator, replica of the Railway Vision PIDS seen in MTR](https://github.com/HKTSS/mtr-pids)
- [sudo-pwd, userscript that make GitHub sudo mode to always ask for password instead of GitHub mobile](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/sudo-pwd)
- [krunner-teleprefix, Telephone Prefix lookup for KRunner](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/krunner-teleprefix)
